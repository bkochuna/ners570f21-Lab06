Overview
========

The developer documentation included in this section of the manual is intended to centralize the information needed for developing and contributing to the Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication library.
The pages should include information about how the code is structured, how it is compiled and build, and how it is tested, along with other useful information regarding code maintenance and development.
Each topic is separated into an individual page, as shown below:

* :ref:`cmake`
* :ref:`testing`
