### Doxygen
To document the source code in this library, we used [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html). This tool parses the source code and automatically generates documentation for classes hierarchies, inheritance, and code interaction. Reference the [Doxygen Installation Guide](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/install.html) to install the tool locally. The Doxygen configuration file and the resulting documentation are included in the `doc/doxygen/` directory. To generate the documentation enter this directory and execute:

```
doxygen config
open html/index.html
```
